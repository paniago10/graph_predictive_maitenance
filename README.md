Files used to make a graph model to simulate machine usefull life
Failure prediction in industry is a topic of extreme importance and necessity today. 
Its roots are intrinsically intertwined with human development and the development of technologies. 
With this in mind, this work was developed in search of an effective way of predicting occurrences using a graph model. 
Based on knowledge of the failure rates of the equipment selected for the study, an industrial axial fan, a model was developed using pycxsimulator library from Python language. 
A validation of the graph model was carried out by means of a statistical comparison using the Student's t-test, with a significance level of 5%
File "dataset_simulation_2.py" was developed in order to create a machine dataset to validate the graph model. No public dataset available fitted to the studied machine.
